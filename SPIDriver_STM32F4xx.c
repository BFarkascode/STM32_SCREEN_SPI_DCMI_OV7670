	 * 1) Enable peripheries and GPIO clocks

	 * 3) SPI5 setup
	 * 4) DMA setup
	 *
	 * SPI is on PF7,PF8 and PF9 on the DISCO board.
	 * DC pin for the ILI is on PD13.
	 * CS pin for the ILI is on PC2.
	 *
	 * Note: SSM needs to be set in order to allow internal interfacing with the ILI chip through SPI
	 * Note: no SPI5 enable and no DMA enable, both will be done locally in a function to allow non-DMA communication when needed
