																				//update the timer if we are overflown/underflow with the counter was reinitialised.
																				//This part is necessary since we can update on the fly. We just need to wait until we are done with a counting cycle and thus an update event has been generated.
																				//also, almost everything is preloaded before it takes effect
																				//update events can be disabled by writing to the UDIS bits in CR1. UDIS as LOW is UDIS ENABLED!!!s

	//NOTE: CCMR1 CC1S is reset to 2'b0, which means CH1 is an output.
	//NOTE: we keep the original polarity (active HIGH) of the output by keeping CCER CC1P as LOW.

	//4)Enable everything
	TIM3->CCER |= (1<<4);														//we enable CH2
	TIM3->CR1 |= (1<<7);														//ARP enabled (ARR will be buffered)
	TIM3->CR1 |= (1<<0);														//timer counter enable bit
	//NOTE: we are edge aligned so no modifications on CR1 CMS

	//5)Update timer registers
	TIM3->EGR |= (1<<0);														//we update TIM3 with the new parameters. This generates an update event.

	while(!(TIM3->SR & (1<<0)));												//wait for the register update flag - UIF update interrupt flag
																				//it will go LOW - and thus, allow the code to pass - when the EGR-controlled TIM2 update has occurred successfully and the registers are updated
																				//we have an update event at the end of each overflow - count up to - or underflow - count down to - moment. Count limit is defined by the ARR.
